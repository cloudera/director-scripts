  # Azure DNS label requirement regex is: ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,61}[a-z0-9]$
  # Cloudera is limiting the DNS label to 26 characters:
  # 17 characters for a user defined prefix
  # 1 character for a dash
  # 8 characters from the 36 character UUID v4 VM name
  # e.g.: <user-defined-prefix>-f47ac10b
  #
  # This regex matches user defined prefix
  #
  instance-prefix-regex: "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,15}[a-z0-9]$"

  #
  # Azure DNS FQDN suffix must be RFC 952 compliant
  # Additional requirements:
  #   Linux host name cannot exceed 64 characters in length or contain the following characters:
  #   ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) = + _ [ ] { } \ | ; : ' " , < > / ?
  #   Each label:
  #     can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
  #     the first character must be a letter
  #     the last character must be a letter or number
  #     the value must be 3 or more characters long
  # Cloudera is limiting the DNS name suffix to 38 characters:
  # 1 charater for the dot (.) that joins the DNS name suffix with the DNS label
  # 37 characters for the user defined DNS FQDN suffix
  #
  # This regex matches the user defined DNS FQDN suffix
  #
  dns-fqdn-suffix-regex: "^(?=.{3,37}$)([a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,35}[a-z0-9])(\\.[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,35}[a-z0-9])*$"
