  # Azure DNS label requirement regex is: ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,61}[a-z0-9]$
  # Cloudera is limiting the DNS label to 26 characters:
  # 17 characters for a user defined prefix
  # 1 character for a dash
  # 8 characters from the 36 character UUID v4 VM name
  # e.g.: <user-defined-prefix>-f47ac10b
  #
  # This regex matches the user defined prefix; here's the breakdown:
  # "([a-z])": a one lowercase alpha character is a valid prefix
  # "|([a-z][a-z0-9])": or a one lowercase alpha character followed by a number is a valid prefix
  # "|([a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,15}[a-z0-9])": or, if the prefix is >= 3 characters long, we use Azure's
  #   regex to validate, with a shorter max length of 17 characters
  #
  instance-prefix-regex: "^(([a-z])|([a-z][a-z0-9])|([a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,15}[a-z0-9]))$"

  #
  # Azure DNS FQDN suffix must be RFC 1123 compliant
  # Additional requirements:
  #   Linux host name cannot exceed 64 characters in length or contain the following characters:
  #   ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) = + _ [ ] { } \ | ; : ' " , < > / ?
  #   Each label:
  #     can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
  #     the first character must be a letter or number
  #     the last character must be a letter or number
  #     the value must be 1 or more characters long
  # Cloudera is limiting the DNS name suffix to 38 characters:
  # 1 charater for the dot (.) that joins the DNS name suffix with the DNS label
  # 37 characters for the user defined DNS FQDN suffix, including any dots (.)
  #
  # Here is the breakdown of the major sections of the regex:
  #   "(?=.{1,37}$)": overall length must be between 1 and 37 inclusive
  #   "(([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]*[a-z0-9])\.)*": match an alphanumeric or an alphanumeric,
  #     followed by any number of alphanumeric and dashes, with the label ending in an
  #     alphanumeric. This match is an optional match which is why it ends with a dot (.).
  #   "([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]*[a-z0-9])": the same matching as before without the requirement
  #     of ending with a dot (.). If there's only one label then the regex only matches this last
  #     section.
  #
  dns-fqdn-suffix-regex: "^(?=.{1,37}$)(([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])\\.)*([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])$"
