#
# Cluster name
#
name: "SDX-Azure Cluster 1"

#
# The environment and deployment name will be generated by default based on the cluster
# name. Another cluster can be bootstrapped under the same deployment by specifying the
# existing environment and deployment name along with a new cluster name. Note that when
# terminating with a configuration file, the deployment is only terminated if there are
# no other clusters under the deployment. Also, the external databases are only terminated
# if there are no other components (deployments or clusters) using the external database.

# The format of this section:
#   - base: represents the core config fields that are common to all nodes
#   - master-base: represents the core config fields that are common to all master nodes
#   - master-1: represents the core config fields that are common to master-1 nodes
#   - master-2: represents the core config fields that are common to master-2 nodes
#   - worker: represents the core config fields that are common to worker nodes
#   - edge: represents the core config fields that are common to edge nodes
#
#
# Instance Template Breakdown
# An instance template configuration consists of the following fields. Unless otherwise specified,
# all fields are required.
#
# - image: The image ID used for instances is an alias defined in the plugin configuration file.
#
# - type: The VM type. See the Azure RA for more detail.
#
# - computeResourceGroup: Resource Group for the deployment.  The Resource Group you specify must
#   exist within the region you selected.
#   See: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/
#
# - networkSecurityGroupResourceGroup: The Resource Group for the Network Security Group. The
#   Resource Group you specify must exist within the region you selected.
#   See: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/
#
# - networkSecurityGroup: The Network Security Group for this instance type, this has to be
#   within the networkSecurityGroupResourceGroup. NSG configuration allows you to limit access to
#   the VM with firewall-like rules.
#   See: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/
#
# - virtualNetworkResourceGroup: The Resource Group for the Virtual Network. The Resource Group you
#   specify must exist within the region you selected and should be the same for all instances that
#   will be used in the same cluster.
#   See: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/
#
# - virtualNetwork: The Azure Virtual Network that will be used, this has to be within the
#   virtualNetworkResourceGroup and should be the same for all instances that will be used in the
#   same cluster.
#   See: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/virtual-network/
#
# - subnetName: The name of the Subnet that will be used, this has to be within the virtualNetwork.
#
# - instanceNamePrefix: Prefix for VM name and hostname of the VM. The VM name will have the
#   folloing format:
#       instanceNamePrefix-{UUID}
#   where {UUID} is generated by the Cloudera Altus Director server.
#
# - hostFqdnSuffix: Hostname FQDN Suffix. This is the DNS domain you configured in your custom DNS
#   server. Example values are: cdh-cluster.internal, cluster.your-company-name.com. The host FQDN
#   is configured on the VMs with the following format:
#       {instanceNamePrefix}-{truncated-UUID}.hostFqdnSuffix
#
# - availabilitySet: Availability Set for this instance type.  Machines within the same availability
#   set will have staggared maintanance times. With a default availability set configuration no more
#   than 1/5 machines will be offline at a time (rounded up).
#   See: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-manage-availability/
#   Sharing Availability Set between master and worker nodes is strongly not recommended.
#
# - publicIP: Should this instance type have Azure Public IP Address and DNS Label?  If Yes, the
#   machine will have a publically resolvable hostname with the folling format:
#       {instanceNamePrefix}-{UUID}.{region}.coudapp.azure.com
#   Allowed values: Yes, No
#
# - storageAccountType: The storage account type to use. The dataDiskSize parameter should be
#   updated based on the storage account type used.
#   The current allowed values are:
#       - Premium_LRS
#       - Standard_LRS
#   See the RA for the supported ways to use standard storage:
#   http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/reference-architecture/PDF/cloudera_ref_arch_azure.pdf
#
# - dataDiskCount: The number of data drives. The size can be specified with `dataDiskSize`
#   Data drives are mounted on /data0 .. /data[n]
#       /data0 - Dedicated Log Device
#   For Masters-1:
#       /data1 - HDFS JournalNode Data
#       /data2 - Zookeeper Data / DataLog
#       /data3 - NameNode Data
#   For Masters-2:
#       /data1 - HDFS JournalNode Data
#       /data2 - Zookeeper Data / DataLog
#   For Workers:
#       /data1 .. /data[n] will be used for HDFS data
#
# - dataDiskSize: The size of each data drive.
#   For disks allocated in a premium storage account, only the following GB values are allowed:
#       512 (P20 disk)
#       1023 (P30 disk) - for backwards compatibility
#       1024 (P30 disk)
#       2048 (P40 disk)
#       4095 (P50 disk)
#   For disks allocated in a standard storage account, any size between 1 and 4095 inclusive can
#   be used.
#   See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/ and
#   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-premium-storage/
#
# - managedDisks: Whether or not to use managed disks.
#   Managed Disks are enabled by default. To use Storage Accounts set this field to "No".
#   In order for managed disks to be used, the availability set must be aligned to use
#   managed disks. For additional details about managed disks see:
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview
#
# - useCustomManagedImage: Whether or not to use a custom (managed) image.
#   Custom images are only supported when using Managed Disks (`managedDisks` must be `Yes`).
#
# - customImagePlan: The custom VM image purchase plan.
#   The purchase plan for the original VM image used to create the custom image. This can be:
#       - an empty string ("")
#       - a string with the format /publisher/<publisher>/product/<product>/name/<name>
#
# - tags (optional): Additional tags to help label resources within Azure
#
# - bootstrapScripts: The bootstrap scripts (see the bootstrap-script section)

# Bootstrap script
#
# See azure.reference.conf for general information about bootstrap scripts and
# pre-terminate scripts.
#
# The os-generic bootstrap script will be run after the VM boots up for the first time. This must
# be used to set up preconditions for successful cluster deployment. Director will restart the
# host after the bootstrap script has run.
#
# The example below is an os-generic script that supports these OSes:
#   - CentOS 6
#   - CentOS 7
#   - RHEL 6
#   - RHEL 7
#
# The script prepares the OS for cluster installation. It also configures a dhclient or
# NetworkManager hook (depending on OS) to register the A record and PTR record with the DNS server
# configured for the VNET to satisfy proper forward and reverse DNS resolution. Azure's default DNS
# currently does not support Reverse Lookup on private IP Addresses, which is a requirement for
# CDH. See the following link for an example BIND setup to satisfy this requirement:
# http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/director/latest/topics/director_get_started_azure_ddns.html
#
# The scrip also sets required settings for RHEL.
