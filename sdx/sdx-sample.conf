# The environment and deployment name will be generated by default based on the cluster
# name. Another cluster can be bootstrapped under the same deployment by specifying the
# existing environment and deployment name along with a new cluster name. Note that when
# terminating with a configuration file, the deployment is only terminated if there are
# no other clusters under the deployment. Also, the external databases are only terminated
# if there are no other components (deployments or clusters) using the external database.
